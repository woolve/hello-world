# hello-world

First walkthrough in github
Today i have decided to play with github, at work i am using gitlab and i am familiar with many code version systems, but the cloud is present. It is time to change the working behaviour. Recently i have read a article about https://stackblitz.com/. I will join a crossite team to develop further an angular frontend. Well, even i am developing many years (more than 15 years) i was long time seperated from frontend development.
IT ecosystem is getting more complex, but in the same time there are huge challenges and developments, that makes our life easier.

Just look at the blogs at stackblitz and read the articles. If you are familiar with web development and cloud deployments you will understand the great progress
